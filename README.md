## About
The Co-operator is a co-op management tool intregrating features from both myCourses and myFuture. Group 5 mainly focuses on developing from the student viewpoint. Keeping this in mind, the second deliverable includes: 

1. Software Quality Assurance Report
2. Unit Testing of Backend 
3. Integration Testing 
4. Build System

Tools that were used for this Deliverable include: Eclipse, SpringBoot, Gradle, UML Lab, ZenHub, Heroku & Draw.Io

## Technical Issues
- Installation of UML Lab
- Deployment of our Spring Application to Heroku due to an additional folder that was created in github and not using the backend folder     already provided for this project. Since the settings.gradle file was pointing to backend folder and not the personalized folder, it       would push an error on terminal
- Issues generating Java code through UML; this was fixed by adding the correct packaging to the project
