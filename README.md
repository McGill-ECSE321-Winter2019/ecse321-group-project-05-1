## About
The Co-operator is a co-op management tool intregrating features from both myCourses and myFuture. Group 5 mainly focuses on developing from the student viewpoint. Keeping this in mind, the third deliverable includes: 

1. Architecture Modelling
2. Implementation of Web Frontend
3. Integration of Web Frontend with Backend Services
4. Build System
5. Documentation

Tools that were used for this Deliverable include: Gradle, Heroku, Postman, Travis CI, Heroku PostgreSQL, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Technical Issues
- Trouble persisting data into the Heroku database
- Issues styling the UI 
- We were able to integrate with the POST methods but not the GET methods

- Our latest build runs perfectly fine on Travis. Continuous Integration is successful too. The latest version of the app (with BackEnd REST added) is available on the link above. Refer to Wiki documentation to see how to access those REST methods.

## Front End Explanation
 - FrontEnd Heroku is deployed correctly now. Please visit https://frontend-take2-murmur.herokuapp.com/#/. We also ensured that if you create any new student (or do anything on the frontend), it gets stored in the database. For ex, create a new student. Go to Postman or Rest Client and create a GET request with http://cryptic-coast-32220.herokuapp.com/students . You will see that the student you have created shows up.
 - Travis works perfectly fine with the BackEnd. "Elias Al Homsi", the T.A said that Travis cannot be integrated with the FrontEnd. 
 - Please create a new student and coop before accessing initial/technical/evaluation report methods. 
 - Frontend Screenshots can be found at https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2019/ecse321-group-project-05-1/wiki/Frontend-Screenshots
 ## New in Front End Version 2!
 - Secure login for authorization added for returning students.
 - New Page added to menu for showing previously submitted document links and instructor ID. 
 - As a new student, you only need to put your McGill ID once.
 - As a new student, you donâ€™t need to remember your COOPID through the dashboard.
 - As a returning student, you need to only enter COOPID once,and the system will remember the ID till you logout.
 - Fixed a bug where "Welcome Student" was not displayed when the frontend was deployed to heroku!
 - Enhanced UI, by adding calender and options on the "addcoop" page. Previously they were all text fields.
