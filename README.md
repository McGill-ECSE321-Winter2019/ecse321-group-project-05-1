## About
The Co-operator is a co-op management tool intregrating features from both myCourses and myFuture. Group 5 mainly focuses on developing from the student viewpoint. Keeping this in mind, the second deliverable includes: 

1. REST API implementation
2. Software Quality Assurance Report
3. Unit Testing of Backend 
4. Integration Testing 
5. Build System

Tools that were used for this Deliverable include: Eclipse, SpringBoot, Gradle, ZenHub, Heroku, Postman, Local PostgreSQL server, Travis CI

## Technical Issues
- Installed Postman to test our REST methods locally
- We created a postgreSQL database locally to check if our post requests worked
- We had to reconfigure our database connection
